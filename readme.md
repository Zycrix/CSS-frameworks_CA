# CSS frameworks CA

This is the repository for the CSS frameworks Course assignment. The goal for this project was to build a basic social media app with bootstrap and scss overrides and include some basic functionality like html form validation

## Running this repository

The code in this repo is using bootstrap, scss and live-server. Before you run this repo please do:

```
npm install bootstrap

npm install -D scss

npm install -D live-server

npm run build

npm run watch
```

### Please note:

This is a work in progress. I've only implemented basic js functionality and the design still needs some work. For now i've only made the parts required for this weeks assignment and updates may come if we continue to work on this assignment trough the upcoming courses.
