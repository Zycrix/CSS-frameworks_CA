/*I know bootstrap includes its own media queries but after reading the documentation i really can't see any benefit to using they're media query functions over the standard css ones, except for the fact that the breakpoint widths are already chosen to a default value. because of this i chose to keep this section like this for now. For the next project or if we're going to be working more on this site i will probably include it just to have done it but for now i can't see the value in it.*/
